Hi,
This is my project for my Computer Graphics class at AGH. It envolved creating an exif and iptc info photo reader.

Its functionalities include:
Saving all exif data from chosen photo library to a single file
Creating new photos with its most important data or user-defined comments embedded onto the image on the top left side.
Easily showing all relevant information about the image.

Usage:
After opening the aplication, you have to choose the folder from which the photos will be read. It is done by the top button in the GUI.
When all images show on the screen, you can double-click on any one of them to show their information.
Functions like saving data to file and creating new images all have their seperate buttons in the GUI.

Hope you find it useful, thank you!
